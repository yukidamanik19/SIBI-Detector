# 🤟 SIBI Detector – Indonesian Sign Language Recognition System

A final-year capstone project focused on building a real-time Indonesian Sign Language (SIBI) recognition system using **MediaPipe** and **custom-trained gesture recognition models**. This project aims to improve accessibility for the deaf community by translating hand gestures into readable text through a web-based AI application.
